- Student Management:
  - Upload student lists in standard formats (e.g., CSV) for bulk blocking/unblocking actions.

- Blocking/Unblocking Functionality:
  - User-friendly interface for selecting students and applying blocking/unblocking actions.
  - Display current status (blocked/unblocked) of each student's email address.
  - Schedule blocking/unblocking actions for future dates.

Non-Functional Requirements

- Security:
  - Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations.
  - Protect user access and student data with appropriate security measures.

- Performance:
  - Ensure responsiveness and efficient handling of bulk actions without significant delays.

- Scalability:
  - Accommodate a growing number of students and users as the system scales.

- Usability:
  - Provide a user-friendly and intuitive interface for authorized users of varying technical expertise.

- Additional Considerations:
  - Integrate with existing email infrastructure.
  - Provide user training materials.
  - Develop a disaster recovery plan to ensure system availability in case of outages.

Technical Components

Tech Stack

- Frontend:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript

- Backend:
  - Linux
  - Apache Web Server
  - PHP with Laravel framework

- Database:
  - MySQL

- API:
  - RESTful services

LAMP Stack

The portal is built using the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), a robust platform for developing web applications.

Setup

- Install LAMP:
  - Use XAMPP Control Panel and Visual Studio Code for development.

- Database Design:
  - Create a MySQL database to store student information with relevant fields like Mail ID, Password, ID, etc.

- Web Development with PHP:
  - Develop core functionalities like user authentication, routing, and database interaction using PHP.

- UI Design:
  - Structure content with HTML and style it using CSS.
  - Design an intuitive interface for administrators to manage student data.

Security Considerations

- User Authentication:
  - Implement a secure login system with PHP.
  
- Regular Backups:
  - Ensure regular backups of the database and website files.

Deployment

- Web Server Configuration:
  - Configure the Apache server to serve the website and interact with the MySQL database.

- Testing & Deployment:
  - Perform thorough testing before deploying to a live environment. Conduct user acceptance testing to ensure the system meets requirements.

#### Limitations

- Complexity:
  - Building complex applications requires significant development expertise.
  
- Security:
  - Maintaining security necessitates ongoing updates and vigilance.

Workflow

User Login

- Authorized personnel access the portal using their email and password.

Student Selection

- Users can choose individual students or select groups based on predefined criteria (e.g., department, year).
- Users can upload a CSV file containing a list of students' email addresses for bulk actions.

Action Selection

- Users specify whether to block or unblock the selected student email addresses.
- An option to schedule blocking/unblocking for a future date and time may be enabled.

Confirmation and Processing

- A confirmation screen summarizes the selected students and the chosen action (block/unblock).
- Upon confirmation, the system executes the blocking/unblocking action.

Additional Considerations

- The system may provide functionalities for searching and filtering students.
- Users can save frequently used student groupings for quicker selection in future tasks.
- Clear notifications and messages guide users throughout the workflow.

Conclusion

This portal system provides a secure, scalable, and user-friendly solution for managing the email status of students in bulk. By leveraging the LAMP stack and focusing on usability, it ensures that authorized personnel can efficiently perform blocking and unblocking actions with minimal effort.
